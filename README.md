# Title:

Web Application with Chatbot Assistant and OCR Capability

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to create a web application that combines the Django backend framework with the React TypeScript Next.js frontend framework. The application will utilize the OpenAI API to provide a chatbot assistant that can assist users with various tasks such as writing reports, translating text, and other school-related activities. Additionally, the chatbot will have the ability to read text from images using OCR (optical character recognition) technology through a library such as Tesseract.js.

## Features:

User authentication and authorization using Django authentication system
Integration with OpenAI API to provide chatbot assistance
OCR capability to read text from images
Report writing assistance using the chatbot
Translation assistance using the chatbot
User-friendly interface with responsive design using React and Next.js
Architecture:
The backend will be built using Django and will provide RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume. The frontend will be built using React TypeScript and Next.js and will be responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend APIs. The chatbot assistant will be integrated with the OpenAI API and OCR functionality will be implemented using a library such as Tesseract.js.

## Deployment:

The web application will be deployed to a cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) will be implemented using tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Learning Goals:

Develop skills in building web applications using Django and React TypeScript Next.js
Gain experience in integrating with external APIs and libraries
Learn about OCR technology and its implementation in web applications
Practice deploying web applications to cloud platforms and implementing CI/CD.
