# Functional Specification:

## Title:

Web application with chatbot assistant and OCR capability

## Vision:

The goal of this project is to create a web application that provides a chatbot assistant and OCR (optical character recognition) capability to assist users with various tasks such as report writing, translation, and school-related activities.

## Core functions:

User authentication and authorization using Django authentication system
Integration with OpenAI API to provide chatbot assistance
OCR capability to read text from images
Report writing assistance using the chatbot
Translation assistance using the chatbot
User-friendly interface with responsive design using React and Next.js
Technological Specification:

## Client framework:

React TypeScript Next.js

## Server framework/backend service setup:

Django

## Architecture:

The backend will provide RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume. The frontend will be responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend APIs. The chatbot assistant will be integrated with the OpenAI API and OCR functionality will be implemented using a library such as Tesseract.js.

## Technology Choices:

The client-side framework chosen is React TypeScript Next.js, which is a highly popular framework for building single-page applications. It provides efficient rendering of components and seamless client-side routing. The server-side framework chosen is Django, which is a high-level Python web framework that provides a fast development process and a robust application structure. The Django authentication system will be used for user authentication and authorization.

## Deployment:

The web application will be deployed to a cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) will be implemented using tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Scope:

The scope of the project includes developing a web application with a user-friendly interface that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide a chatbot assistant and OCR capability. The application will also integrate with Django authentication system for user authentication and authorization. The deployment of the application will be done on a cloud platform with CI/CD implementation.

## Complexity:

The chosen frameworks, React TypeScript Next.js and Django, have varying levels of complexity. However, with the right amount of research and experience, they can be implemented with relative ease. The integration of the OpenAI API and OCR capability may add some complexity to the project.
